## The Motivation
<details>
  
Growing up in Brazil, my dogs and cats friends were always mutts, I would find them on the streets and I would bring them home and I would bring my most sad face and the most incredible compelling pitch in hope that my mom would allow me to keep them and in many occasions she did. Despite knowing that going to the vet for check ups is important for you and your pet, my childhood doggies and cats never saw a vet and they lived furever (did you see what I did here ðŸ˜‰). 
However, when I moved to US and I was able to afford, everyone would tell me to look for a breeder with AKC registration and that paying the price up front would allow me to have a health dog later, so I believed the idea. After purchasing two Rottweiler from a back yard breeder for $500 a pop, my furry kids grew up with a lot of joint and health problems. The issues included 3 joint surgeries, constant allergies, skin, and ear infections, bone cancer, hip dysplasia, and painful arthritis, combined with endless vet bills and medication. I loved my dogs, and I would do it all over again, however I discovery a much cheaper, sustainable and still loveable way to find your furry friendâ€¦SHELTERS!!!

## The Question

Why adopt a pet if you can easily buy one?

## The Dream

My first approach was to research the area of Nashville or at least investigate any city or county in Tennessee. Gather all the dataset for shelters and/or animals rescues and animal humane societies near by.

## The Reality

I was unable to find available data for Nashville and very little for most of the cities or counties in TN.  Emails were sent requesting the data , but no answers.

## The Plan B

I went where the data took me, where it was available.  So... Texas it is then!

## The Data
This project analyze data from Shelter Animals Count(SAC) from 2019 to 2021 and OpenData.net dataset for Dallas and Austin, TX cities regarding their shelters activities from 2015 to 2022.
