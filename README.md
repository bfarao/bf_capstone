## The Motivation
  
Growing up in Brazil, my dogs and cats’ friends were always mutts, I would find them on the streets, and I would bring them home and I would bring my most sad face and the most incredible compelling pitch in hope that my mom would allow me to keep them and on many occasions she did. Despite knowing that going to the vet for checkups is important for you and your pet, my childhood doggies and cats never saw a vet and they lived furrever.

However, when I moved to US and I was able to afford a pet, everyone would tell me to look for a breeder with AKC registration and that paying the price up front would allow me to have a healthy dog later, so I believed on the idea. After purchasing two Rottweiler from a back yard breeder for $500 a pop, my furry kids grew up with a lot of joint and health problems. The issues included 3 joint surgeries, constant allergies, skin, and ear infections, bone cancer, hip dysplasia, and painful arthritis, combined with endless vet bills and medications. I loved my dogs, and I would do it all over again, however I discovery a much cheaper, sustainable, and still very loveable way to find my furry friend…SHELTERS!!!

There so many mistreated animals and a lot of overbreeding pets that leads to major health concerns when they grow up. Puppy mills are a big business in this country, where especially dogs are bred in very poor conditions leading to unhealthy puppies and a very short and painful lifespan for the mothers. Also, there are so many great companions in shelters that in many cases they are euthanized because of the lack of space, resources, and not enough adoptions.


## The Question

Why adopt a pet if you can easily buy one?

What kind of pets are available for adoption?

## The Dream

My first approach was to research the area of Nashville or at least investigate any city or county around Metro Area. Gather all the dataset for shelters and/or animals rescues and animal humane societies near by. The reason why is because I live in this area and with this research, I could help somehow the community around me, spot trends, and help guiding the shelters to better marketing campaigns or to specific area. And I even went a step further and opened my search to the whole state of TN in case Nashville failed through.

## The Reality

I was unable to find available data for Nashville and very little for most of the cities or counties in TN. The few that I was able to find did not contain the necessary information to help me to answer my question. Emails were sent requesting the data , but no answers.
As my instructor said, you have to go where the data is… so I did, and I ended up in TX.

## The Data
This project analyze data from [Shelter Animals Count](https://www.shelteranimalscount.org/) and [Open Data Network](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/) dataset for two TX cities regarding their shelters activities.
Shelter Animals Count (SAC) dataset contains information from shelters around the US and it's divided by state and year for Felines and Canines only. The data is for the year of 2019, 2020, and 2022.
The second dataset from Open Data Network are for Austin and Dallas, TX from 2015 to 2022.

## The Technology

* Python
  * Jupyter Notebooks
  * pandas
  
* Power BI dashboard

## The Process

### Gather

Downloaded multiple CSV files from data sources.

### Clean

The cleaning part of my project was the one that took the most of my time.

For the SAC dataset had a lot of columns with a variety of information for both felines and canines.
