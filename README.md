Adopt Don't Shop: A Look into Overfilled Animal Shelters and Euthanization Rates.

My Motivation:
Growing up in Brazil, my dogs and cats friends were always mutts, I would find them on the streets and I would bring them home and I would bring my most sad face and the most incredible compelling pitch in hope that my mom would allow me to keep them and in many occasions she did. Despite knowing that going to the vet for check ups is important for you and your pet, my childhood doggies and cats never saw a vet and they lived furever (did you see what I did here ðŸ˜‰). 
However, when I moved to US and I was able to afford, everyone would tell me to look for a breeder with AKC registration and that paying the price up front would allow me to have a health dog later, so I believed the idea. After purchasing two Rottweiler from a back yard breeder for $500 a pop, my furry kids grew up with a lot of joint and health problems. The issues included 3 joint surgeries, constant allergies, skin, and ear infections, bone cancer, hip dysplasia, and painful arthritis, combined with endless vet bills and medication. I loved my dogs, and I would do it all over again, however I discovery a much cheaper, sustainable and still loveable way to find your furry friendâ€¦SHELTERS!!!
